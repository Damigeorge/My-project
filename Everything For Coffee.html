<p>The origin of coffee dates back to 600 A.D. There are several legends about the origin of coffee, one of which states that are in eastern Africa, a shepherd called <strong>Kaldi</strong> observed his goats were overactive when they ate cherry-red berries from a shrub. He tried to eat some of the berries, and found himself vigorated too. Soon, news spread about the stimulating effects of these berries, and monks started using the berries to stay awake during the long hours of prayer. From Eastern Africa, coffee was transported to Arabia and then to Turkey, where they roasted the beans and boiled them and gave rise to the crude crude form of coffee that we use today. Soon, coffee spread to Europe, America, and other continents. It is one of the most popular beverages enjoyed by multitudes of people all over the world and is available in different varieties.Some of the international favorites are Cappucino, Mocha, Latte, and Frapp&eacute.
