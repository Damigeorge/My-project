<p><h1><u>Education for societal relevance 4</u></h1></p>

<p><h2>We are busy talking about education for societal relevance but how equipped are the educators? I’m grateful for my school but not all schools are able to employ quality teachers and even train them to understand the 21st century education demands. Believe me, there’s still so much work to be done.</h2></p>

<p><h2>Good day great people of Nigeria, my name is DAMILOLA and I represent year 9. I am here today to speak on the topic: Education for Societal Relevance. We are talking about how to shift our education system for theories to practical applicable knowledge and experience. But we still have schools in this country that don’t have the theories to start with. That is why I say that there is so much work to be done.</h2></p>

<p><h2>Do we still have nationalists in this country? Where are all the nation builders and great thinkers? History tells us that our nation was liberated by nationalists. When did we all become so selfish and think so less and little of our country? “Once my child is getting a good education, who cares about others?” “once I’m able to educate my child abroad, I’m okay.” How convenient!</h2></p>

<p><h2>We forget that the majority who are unable to receive quality education are still going to interact with us tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s only by working together, progressing together, that we can fully experience societal national relevance.</h2></p>

<p><h2>What am I trying to say? Have I deviated? NO! I’m just saying that this topic concerns us all as a nation more. We need every child in Nigeria to have access to quality education. So all public schools need to be upgraded. Even all private schools need to step up their game. I want to call on the government and all who are decision makers to focus on investing more on education, employ quality teachers, train them and even pay them  well so that they can give us the education that can make us relevant. Thank you.</h2></p>

		<p><h1>HOW EDUCATION STARTED AND HOW IT DEVELOPED</h1></p>
<p><h2>The origin of education dates back TO 1234 B.C. There are several legends about the origin of education, one of which states that in Eastern Africa, a young trader, kaldi observed that his children and apprentices were overactive with dumbness amd recklessness. He tried to look for one who would make their life better after doing some few things, then, he came up with an idea.He began to train his children and make them to write what they say. This, at that point in time, was called teaching. It was actually alot of stress to the father, because of lack os economic, financial and social support. then, he thought of another lan, he thought that if he could teach his own children and make them understand what they say and do in the everyday life, he thought that teaching other children won't be a  bad idea. This was how education started.</h2></p>
